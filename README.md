* Assuming a piece of software is already highly decentralised and anonymised
  so that particular persons cannot be identified, if a developer designs their
  software distribution system to ensure they have no control over the channels
  particular persons can update their software (Eg: BitTorrent, mirrors, or other
  broadcast-like technology unlike Google and their Play Store and Apple and
  their Appstore), would that be sufficient enough to ensure the software update
  process is no longer be utilised as an attack-vector against a particular
  person as ordered by a TCN?

* What happens when a company cannot comply to a warrant or a Notice because of
  technical design (i.e don't hold any keys or data)

* Can the government walk up to me, demand I create a backdoor in my work
  software or access work databases, and I can't tell my employer or client

	* and fixes it
	* and notifies others

* Are we able to handle any European data in Australia as it could be a
  potential violation of GPDR

* When a weakness is discovered, what happens when it's fixed by someone not
  under a Notice

* What happens when to target a user, we would have to decrypt for all users

* What happens if we do client-side encryption - do we have to modify the
  decryption to target an individual?
	* What are the ramifications if we are caught if we can't target the payload
	  to the individual and so have to serve it to everyone (think CDN)?

	  risk of disclosure

* If we are served with a TCN, TAR, or TAN, is it legal to engage a lawyer, or
  does the non-discloseure provisions include attorney-client privilege?

* If I am served a TCN, but the execution of it would breach GDPR or HIPPA,
  what do I do?

	* (Context for question: concern around chilling effects the law may have on
	  reporting/discussing non-AAbill backdoor

* How will this interact with the consumer law?
	* If we sell a product labelled as secure and we're forced to add a flaw into
		that security does the customer have a right to refund under the consumer
    law as unfit for purpose?
	* Could we then have cause for the government to cover any financial losses
	  related to this as the customers issue comes from the governments order?

* In a case where an employee complies with a technical capability notice (TCN),
  backdoors their company's software, and is subsequently dismissed by the

  with regards to unfair dismissal or any form of compensation for loss of
  income?

  software when stable and reliable software have licenses which provide no
  enterprise support and no obligation to change for its users.

* What are the obligations of open source maintainers for software directed to
  break down security?

* If there is no maintainer (passed away etc), will it be mandated to fork a
  repository to take on additional responsibility and capability just to
  introduce security flaws? How will this work, its resources and the
  sustainability of said problems be funded - even in the event no funding or
  liquidation is occurring.

* Upstream changes required to meet a Capability Notice for code maintained
	outside of Australia. What will happen to projects which have multiple
	parties across the world including if only one Australian citizen is
  maintaining?

* Are maintainers expected to introduce security flaws to comply with a Notice
  and not consult other maintainers, stakeholders or the community - even when
  tight approval processes are already in place to prevent the scenario being
  imposed?
