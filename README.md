1. There has been confusion around who can recieve a warrant, TAN, TAR, and
	 TCN. Some people are saying that only telco providers in the traditional
	 sense receive these and then get staff and contractors to execute them,
	 while others say that anyone can be approached directly who have knowledge
	 of a system or the capability to access and modify a system, regardless of
	 their current status: i.e local or remote, citizen or foreigner, employee or
   contractor or former employee or ever hobbyist.

   Who can be approached with a warrent, TAN, TAR, and TCN to execute it?

2. Can these warrants and notices force you to build or modify software that
	 circumvents a product's security, your company's security, or even somebody
	 else's security (not the target), so that they can use it as a stepping
   stone to get into the target's computer.

	 E.g. their target buys your microphone, which needs a Windows driver to run.
	 Can you be forced to modify your Windows driver and push a targetted update
   that will then allow spying or even remote access to their computer)

3. If approached directly with a warrant or notice, are you allowed to tell
	 anyone? e.g colleagues in order to assist in executing them, bosses to let
	 them know they are compromising the safety of their systems and their own
	 work schedule will be affected, and legal team to check validity of request

4. What happens if there is a bug in your execution of the warrant or notice,
   which leads to unauthorised disclosure?

5. When approached with a warrant or notice, how does one verify the
   authenticity of the people serving them, and the legality of the request?

6. Are warrant canary's legal or even possible to disclose warrants or notices?

* Assuming a piece of software is already highly decentralised and anonymised
  so that particular persons cannot be identified, if a developer designs their
  software distribution system to ensure they have no control over the channels
  particular persons can update their software (e.g.: BitTorrent, mirrors, or other
  broadcast-like technology unlike Google and their Play Store and Apple and
  their Appstore), would that be sufficient enough to ensure the software update
  process is no longer be utilised as an attack-vector against a particular
  person as ordered by a TCN?

  potential violation of GPDR

* When a weakness is discovered, what happens when it is fixed by someone not
  under a Notice

* What happens when to target a user, we would have to decrypt for all users

* What happens if we do client-side encryption - do we have to modify the
  decryption to target an individual?
	* What are the ramifications if we are caught if we can not target the payload
	  to the individual and so have to serve it to everyone (think CDN)?

* Can you be fired for complying with a warrant or Notice because you

* what happens when a TCN change is inadvertently altered or has a bug

* Are there punishments here?

* must a TCN be specific in its target(s)? It seems vastly different asking for

  industry, especially when things are not 100% successful.

* Are Australians overseas subject to these notices?

* Would a warrant canary be a viable way of alerting employers/anyone that you
  have been compelled to "assist" or is this useless due to a law passed in

* Who can issue warrants and Notices

* A technical person reviewing code/config/state finds software/configuration
  that they believe may be the result of a TCN, or may be a malicious backdoor.
	If they communicate information about what they have found to another person,

	* (Context for question: concern around chilling effects the law may have on
	  reporting/discussing non-AAbill backdoor

* How will this interact with the consumer law?
	* If we sell a product labelled as secure and we are forced to add a flaw into
		that security does the customer have a right to refund under the consumer
    law as unfit for purpose?
	* Could we then have cause for the government to cover any financial losses
	  related to this as the customers issue comes from the governments order?

* In a case where an employee complies with a technical capability notice (TCN),
  backdoors their company's software, and is subsequently dismissed by the
	employer for undermining said software. What options does the employee have
  with regards to unfair dismissal or any form of compensation for loss of
  income?

* Can Article 12 or any other UDHR and/or other foreign or domestic legislation
	relating to privacy protection be used as a legal basis for not complying
  with a TCN?

* I would like to know how this bill will impact the use of open source
  software when stable and reliable software have licenses which provide no
  enterprise support and no obligation to change for its users.

* What are the obligations of open source maintainers for software directed to
  break down security?

* If there is no maintainer (passed away etc), will it be mandated to fork a
  repository to take on additional responsibility and capability just to
  introduce security flaws? How will this work, its resources and the
  sustainability of said problems be funded - even in the event no funding or
  liquidation is occurring.

* Upstream changes required to meet a Capability Notice for code maintained
	outside of Australia. What will happen to projects which have multiple
	parties across the world including if only one Australian citizen is
  maintaining?

* Are maintainers expected to introduce security flaws to comply with a Notice
  and not consult other maintainers, stakeholders or the community - even when
  tight approval processes are already in place to prevent the scenario being
  imposed?

* what, if any, legislation allows for intelligence agencies to insert covert
  assets into organisations

* What we need to do to repeal this law? Is it even possible?

* how does this law affect working visa holders/permanent residents?

* If forced to build backdoors, what happens with open source software?
	* Under most open source software licenses, wouldn't open source software
	  vendors be required to inform users that some of the code is going to be
    closed source?

* Is it possible that the Government could avoid the restriction of creating
  systemic weakness, by forcing tech companies to serve malicious updates to
  specific targets.

* what would happen if a TCN required us to violate a copyright license? (For
  instance, we are forced to add a backdoor to a GPLv3+ work and then ship it
  to a user -- legally we have to give them the source code but this would
  disclose the backdoor.)

* Is refusing to simply give up a password enough to be penalised under the
  bill
